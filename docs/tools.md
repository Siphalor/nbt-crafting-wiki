When working with datapacks, recipes and nbt data there are useful resources to work with and learn about that whole JSON mess that makes Minecraft what it is.

This is a site collecting useful resources and tools for working with datapacks and recipes.

- If you want to learn more about [datapacks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_Pack), [recipes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Recipe) and more at the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_Wiki).
- I personally use [MCStacker](https://mcstacker.net)'s `/give` generator to build the nbt data. To convert this data to be usable in Nbt Crafting you'll need to add quotes around the JSON keys (`Name: ...` -> `"Name": ...`).
- If you want to a user interface for building the json recipes, you can use the [crafting generator](https://crafting.thedestruc7i0n.ca) by TheDesctruc7i0n. The online generators don't support nbt data but can be a good way to get basic recipes working.
